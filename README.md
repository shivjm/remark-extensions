# remark-extensions

An assortment of extensions and plugins for use with [the remark Markdown processor](https://remark.js.org/) and [the rehype HTML processor](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype/). See [the documentation](https://shivjm.github.io/remark-extensions) for more.

* [hast-split-pre-lines](./packages/hast-split-pre-lines/)
* [micromark-extension-kbd-nested](./packages/micromark-extension-kbd-nested/)
* [remark-editorial-elements](./packages/remark-editorial-elements/)
* [remark-kbd-nested](./packages/remark-kbd-nested/)
* [remark-textras](./packages/remark-textras/)

There are some duplicated helper functions between remark-editorial-elements and remark-textras since I havenâ€™t yet decided where to put them after moving them from [my blog](https://shivjm.blog/).
